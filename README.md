# Psychic-Game


In this game, the computer will choose a random letter. The player has 9 guesses to pick the right letter, which you can do by pressing any letter on the keyboard. The game will keep track of your guesses so far. After you run out of guesses, you will have a loss in the "loss" column; similarly, if you win the game, the game will update your "wins" score.
